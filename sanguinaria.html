                        <p>The first videogame I developed as part of a team. This was our project for the Masters Degree. The team was called Alea Games Studio, and consisted of 20 people divided in 
                            Development, Design, Art and Production. I was part of the Development deparment along with 4 other colleages. <br>
                            My main role in this team was to develop the AI behavior for the enemies. Since the game was developed with Unreal Engine 5, I used the engine tools to program it.<br>
                            Everything was done using mostly C++. The final result of my work included:
                        </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3 different behavior trees and blackboards for three different types of enemy.</li>
                                <li>Use of AI Senses for detection.</li>
                                <li>Development of the enemies design (movement, attacks, area of interest...).</li>
                                <li>Use of EQS for the enemies movement</li>
                                <li>A Token Attack System for a more balanced experience.</li>
                                <li>Outside of AI I also helped with the final boss, the VFX implementation, UI and optimization and bug fixing.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>The game is uploaded to steam and free to play. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2984200/Sanguinaria/"> <h3>Click here</h3></a>
                        <h2>About the game</h2>
