                        <p>This is the first videogame I developed. It's an university project that aims to be a game for kids of ages between 3-6 years.<br>
                            The project required research in order to adapt the game to the infants' capabilities, so I followed the laws of Early Childhood Education and adjusted the gameplay to them.<br>
                            Since this was an individual project, my responsibilities were everything involving the game:<br></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The gameplay of all 3 minigames.</li>
                                <li>Programming everything, done in Unity with C#.</li>
                                <li>The UI and its functionality.</li>
                                <li>The art, which was done with Unity tools, public domain images and by hand, using Photoshop to import them.</li>
                                <li>The audio, for which I used public domain AI generated voice to record every line the character says in-game.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>    I recently uploaded it to itch.io for anyone to play it. <a href="https://nickinair.itch.io/aprende-con-ines"> <h3>Here's the link</h3></a>
                        <h2>About the game</h2>
                        <p>You meet your friend Ines in your backyard. She offers you to go play with her to 3 different places: you can go to the museum to see paintings and learn their names; you can go to the park to 
                            learn english; or your can even go to space to learn to add.
